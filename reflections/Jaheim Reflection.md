My main contributions to the CHROME101 project were the home page and one of the news article pages. The home page was definitely the most demanding part for me. I decided to go for a Y2K aesthetic there, and it involved a lot of experimentation to get it right. I played around with 'ransom' lettering to try and capture that specific vibe, and I spent a considerable amount of time creating paper cutout images with drop shadows to give it that scrapbook feel. It was tricky to pull all those elements together, but I'm happy with the unique look it gave the site's entry point.

In contrast, the news article page was a different process. For that page, I took inspiration from the layout and design principles of the New York Times blog, focusing on clear typography and information hierarchy. While it was important to ensure it complemented the overall site, the design language was distinct from the home page and, honestly, it was less challenging to execute. The home page required more creative problem-solving, whereas the article page was more about effective information design. I learned a lot about the different approaches needed for different types of pages within a site.
